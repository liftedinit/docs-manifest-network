# Introduction

The digital world is dominated by monopolies of the cloud, controlling access, pricing, and secretly mining your data and IP. The era of digital feudalism has introduced systemic risks such as policies that prioritize control over user data undermines the drive to innovate and weakens the public understanding of their own data resources, rights and economic potential.

At Manifest, we resist this trend. We're building the Sovereign Cloud—a secure, scalable, and decentralized infrastructure layer purpose-built to return control to developers, organizations, and communities. We aim to provide users with full ownership of their data, the freedom of being compute-independent, and infrastructure-level control of the future of AI and digital systems.

Manifest unites the reliability and performance of modern cloud platforms with the user empowerment and transparency of Web3. We offer a unified interface for the management of bare metal compute, object and disk storage, tokenization, mutable and immutable data, and enterprise-ready Kubernetes deployments—fully integrated with Web2 and blockchain ecosystems.

**Key Features**

* **Privacy-First Infrastructure**: Access decentralized infrastructure, industry-leading GPUs, enterprise-grade compute, blockchain-secured storage, managed cloud services, and cutting-edge tools to reliably build, train, optimize, and deploy your AI applications securely.
* **Decentralized Web Services (DeWS)**: A global network of visionaries is leading the charge in bringing a comprehensive suite of services to shape a new era of seamless deployment on a decentralized network.
* **Proof-of-Authority (PoA) Consensus**: Manifest utilizes an Audited Proof-of-Authority Module, relying on a predefined set of trusted validators. This approach offers enhanced efficiency and control, particularly suited for permissioned networks.

**Project Vision**

By integrating the best aspects of Web2 and Web3, Manifest aims to empower individuals and organizations alike, fostering innovation and collaboration across various sectors. Our network is designed to be a catalyst for positive change, enabling secure, transparent, and efficient interactions in the digital realm.

This documentation provides an overview of Manifest's architecture, public endpoints, validator participation guidelines, and more, serving as a comprehensive resource for both potential validators and the broader community.
