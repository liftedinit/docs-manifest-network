# Blockchain Architecture

The Manifest Networkâ€™s blockchain component is currently using the Cosmos SDK framework, with plans of bridging to Base, Solana, and other blockchains in the near future.  Our vision and goal is to be a layer-0 network where our compute power can be called, paid for, and seen with appropriate permissions from any blockchain.\
\
Having a mixed architecture like the Manifest Network has several advantages. &#x20;

* First, Manifest has developed Ghostcloud, a way to host immutable, censorship-resistant data on the blockchain alongside cheaper, mutable data on the Manifest compute nodes.  Ghostcloud is currently being tested as a web hosting service in an early alpha: please contact Manifest through discord if you want to get on our list for technical integration with this protocol.
* Second, the Manifest Network allows for payment on chain through its PWR token, allowing AI agents and other blockchain entities to seamlessly integrate payment for compute, so they may power themselves.  The use of the PWR token for payment also allows our partners to easily plan for compute costs into the future.\
  Token launch is also easy on the Manifest Network, using our token factory found here:[ https://wallet.liftedinit.tech/factory](https://wallet.liftedinit.tech/factory)

Manifest uses a proof-of-authority (PoA) blockchain model, governed by a vetted consortium rather than relying on traditional permissionless mechanisms. This consortium will be handed over to the Manifest governance for voting as the protocol decentralizes.&#x20;
