# Compute Node overview

Manifest Network is engineered from the ground up to deliver the performance of traditional enterprise cloud with the resilience and freedom of decentralized infrastructure. Unlike typical DePIN projects built on hobbyist or consumer hardware, Manifest is powered by a growing fleet of over 300 compute nodes, hosted exclusively in Tier 3 and Tier 4 data centers.

#### Customization & Scalability <a href="#docs-internal-guid-43864208-7fff-ba2e-6420-25f3dc0178ed" id="docs-internal-guid-43864208-7fff-ba2e-6420-25f3dc0178ed"></a>

The Manifest network is designed for flexibility. We are actively refining and evolving node configurations to match the needs of developers, enterprises, and AI builders. Custom infrastructure deployments are available through our node partners, enabling tailored performance across diverse workloads.

**Decentralized Enterprise-Grade Infrastructure**

Our approach allows for very reliable, efficient, single or multi-computer computer compute while still being decentralized: the best mix of web2 and web3 infrastructure. This decentralization ensures that Manifest is inherently resilient to single points of failure, leveraging multiple layers of redundancy:

* **Blockchain Redundancy:** Multiple validators and failover mechanisms.
* **Hardware Redundancy:** Utilizing high-tier data centers.
* **Data center security:** these buildings are run in secure environments, with restricted access, industry-standard IT and physical security, etc.

Our network achieves true decentralization without sacrificing performance, security, or configurability:

* **Mission-Critical Reliability**\
  Hosted in data centers with N+1 (Tier 3) and 2N (Tier 4) redundancy, the Manifest Network targets 99.9% uptime, ensuring your applications stay online—even under stress.\
  \

* **High-Performance Compute**\
  Our infrastructure delivers compute speeds comparable to centralized cloud providers (e.g., AWS), making it ideal for intensive AI, blockchain, and enterprise workloads.\
  \

* **True Decentralization**\
  Manifest’s compute nodes are operated by vetted Node Partners—experienced IT professionals who manage secure installations for independent Node Owners across the globe. This layered network design eliminates single points of failure and resists censorship.
