# Neighborhoods: Customization, Control, and Federated Governance

Manifest introduces Neighborhoods—federated groupings of compute and storage nodes that can be managed collectively by a single entity or community. This architectural concept enables semi-autonomous operation of independent nodes while allowing them to be coordinated, governed, and optimized as a unit within the broader decentralized network.

Neighborhoods are similar in function to “accounts” or “groups” in traditional cloud platforms, but with far greater flexibility and embedded governance. Every partner integrated into the Manifest Network operates within their own Neighborhood, enabling customization and horizontal scalability from day one.

Key advantages of Neighborhoods include:

* **Tailored Governance:** Implement custom rules, policies, and operational controls over your infrastructure slice.\
  \

* **Optimized Performance:** Place nodes geographically close for low-latency needs, or spread them across regions for redundancy and resilience.\
  \

* **Efficient Resource Allocation:** Allocate compute, storage, and services according to project, client, or workload-specific demands.
