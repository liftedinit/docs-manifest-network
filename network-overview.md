# Network Overview

​Manifest operates a decentralized infrastructure that spans North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia, ensuring high availability for applications globally. This extensive network supports a variety of services, including industry-leading GPUs, enterprise-grade compute resources, and blockchain-secured storage solutions. These components collectively provide a robust foundation for deploying and scaling AI applications securely and efficiently.

**Consensus Mechanism**

The network employs a Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism, specifically utilizing an Audited Proof-of-Authority Module. In PoA systems, a limited number of pre-approved and trusted validators are responsible for validating transactions and creating new blocks. This approach leverages the reputation of validators rather than computational power or stake, providing faster transactions and increased scalability.

**Modules and Functionalities**

Manifest's network offers a comprehensive suite of Decentralized Web Services (DeWS), designed for visionary developers and AI applications. Key components include:​

* **Decentralized Infrastructure**: A global network ensuring low latency and high availability.​
* **Enterprise-Grade Compute**: On-demand compute resources adaptable to various workloads.​
* **Blockchain-Secured Storage**: Decentralized storage solutions offering data sovereignty and resilience.​
* **API Wrapped Interoperability**: Seamless integration with existing technology stacks to leverage decentralization benefits without workflow disruption.​
* **Kubernetes Automation**: Streamlined deployment and management of decentralized applications using Kubernetes.​

These modules collectively empower developers and organizations to build, train, optimize, and deploy AI applications securely on a decentralized network. ​

#### Data and Compute Sovereignty and Privacy: Your Data, Your Rules <a href="#docs-internal-guid-7618f17c-7fff-ca32-70a9-bd6e3cdaa806" id="docs-internal-guid-7618f17c-7fff-ca32-70a9-bd6e3cdaa806"></a>

Data Sovereignty isn't a feature on Manifest; it's a fundamental right. Manifest ensures you retain absolute control and ownership. Your data, your models, your IP remain exclusively yours.

We explicitly reject the data exploitation practices common among big tech companies which are currently trying to build AI models with your data..
